# Web Security Testing Guide Checklist

Contained in this folder is an Excel file which provides the following worksheets:

- _Testing Checklist_ - facilitates simple progress tracking against each of the "tests" outlined in the guide.
- _Summary Findings_ - facilitates creating a table of test outcomes and potential recommendations.
- _Risk Assessment Calculator_ - a dropdown driven sheet for calculating likelihood and impact scores, and a qualitative overall risk rating.
- _References_ - provides the lists/sets that the calculator is based upon.

**Note:** The current (Excel) checklist is based on v4.2 of the OWASP Testing Guide, as content for v5 is still under development.
