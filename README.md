Welcome to the official repository for the Open Web Application Security Project® (OWASP®) Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG). The WSTG is a comprehensive guide to testing the security of web applications and web services. Created by the collaborative efforts of security professionals and dedicated volunteers, the WSTG provides a framework of best practices used by penetration testers and organizations all over the world.

We are currently working on release version 5.0. You can [read the current document here on GitHub](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg/tree/master/document).

For the last stable release, [check release 4.2](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg/releases/tag/v4.2). Also available [online](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/).

## How To Reference WSTG Scenarios

Each scenario has an identifier in the format `WSTG-<category>-<number>`, where: 'category' is a 4 character upper case string that identifies the type of test or weakness, and 'number' is a zero-padded numeric value from 01 to 99. For example:`WSTG-INFO-02` is the second Information Gathering test.

The identifiers may change between versions. Therefore, it is preferable that other documents, reports, or tools use the format: `WSTG-<version>-<category>-<number>`, where: 'version' is the version tag with punctuation removed. For example: `WSTG-v42-INFO-02` would be understood to mean specifically the second Information Gathering test from version 4.2.

If identifiers are used without including the `<version>` element, they should be assumed to refer to the latest Web Security Testing Guide content. As the guide grows and changes this becomes problematic, which is why writers or developers should include the version element.

### Linking

Linking to Web Security Testing Guide scenarios should be done using versioned links not `stable` or `latest`, which will change with time. However, it is the project team's intention that versioned links do not change. For example: `https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/02-Fingerprint_Web_Server.html`. Note: the `v42` element refers to version 4.2.
