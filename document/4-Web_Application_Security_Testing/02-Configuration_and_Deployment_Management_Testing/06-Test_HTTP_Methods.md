|WSTG-CONF-06|

## Summary

HTTP offers a number of methods (or verbs) that can be used to perform actions on the web server. While GET and POST are by far the most common methods that are used to access information provided by a web server, there are a variety of other methods that may also be supported, and can sometimes be exploited by attackers.

[RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231) defines the main valid HTTP request methods (or verbs), although additional methods have been added in other RFCs, such as [RFC 5789](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5789). Several of these verbs have been re-used for different purposes in [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) applications, listed in the table below.

| Method | Original Purpose | RESTful Purpose |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| [`GET`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1) | Request a file. | Request an object.|
| [`HEAD`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.2) | Request a file, but only return the HTTP headers. | |
| [`POST`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.3) | Submit data. | |
| [`PUT`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.4) | Upload a file. | Create an object. |
| [`DELETE`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.5) | Delete a file | Delete an object. |
| [`CONNECT`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.6) | Establish a connection to another system. | |
| [`OPTIONS`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.7) | List supported HTTP methods. | Perform a [CORS Preflight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request) request.
| [`TRACE`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.8) | Echo the HTTP request for debug purposes. | |
| [`PATCH`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5789#section-2) |  | Modify an object. |

## Test Objectives

- Enumerate supported HTTP methods.
- Test for access control bypass.
- Test HTTP method overriding techniques.

## How to Test

### Discover the Supported Methods

To perform this test, the tester needs a way to identify which HTTP methods are supported by the web server that is being examined. The simplest way to do this is to make an `OPTIONS` request to the server:

```http
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
```

The server should then respond with a list of supported methods:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST
```

However, not all servers may respond to OPTIONS requests, and some may even return inaccurate information. It's also worth noting that servers may support different methods for different paths. This means that even if a method is not supported for the root / directory, it does not necessarily indicate that the same method won't be supported elsewhere.

A more reliable way to test for supported methods is to simply make a request with that method type, and examine the server response. If the method is not permitted, the server should return a `405 Method Not Allowed` status.

Note that some servers treat unknown methods as equivalent to `GET`, so they may respond to arbitrary methods, such as the request shown below. This can occasionally be useful to evade a web application firewall, or any other filtering that blocks specific methods.

```http
FOO / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
```

Requests with arbitrary methods can also be made using curl with the `-X` option:

```bash
curl -X FOO https://example.org
```

There are also a variety of automated tools that can attempt to determine supported methods, such as the [`http-methods`](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-methods.html) Nmap script. However, these tools may not test for dangerous methods (i.e., methods that may cause changes such as `PUT` or `DELETE`), or may unintentionally cause changes to the web server if these methods are supported. As such, they should be used with care.

### PUT and DELETE

The `PUT` and `DELETE` methods can have different effects, depending on whether they are being interpreted by the web server or by the application running on it.

#### Legacy Web Servers

Some legacy web servers allowed the use of the `PUT` method to create files on the server. For example, if the server is configured to allow this, the request below would create a file on the server called `test.html` with the contents `<script>alert(1)</script>`.

```http
PUT /test.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Content-Length: 25

<script>alert(1)</script>
```

Similar requests can also be made with cURL:

```bash
curl https://example.org --upload-file test.html
```

This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the webserver, which could potentially result in a full system compromise if they are allowed to upload executable code such as PHP files. However, this configuration is extremely rare, and is unlikely to be seen on modern systems.

Similarly, the `DELETE` method can be used to delete files from the webserver. Please note that this is a **destructive action**; therefore, extreme care should be exercised when testing this method.

```http
DELETE /test.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
```

Or with cURL:

```bash
curl http://example.org/test.html -X DELETE
```

#### RESTful APIs

By contrast, the `PUT` and `DELETE` methods are commonly used by modern RESTful applications to create and delete objects. For example, the API request below could be used to create a user called "foo" with a role of "user":

```http
PUT /api/users/foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Content-Length: 34

{
    "role": "user"
}
```

A similar request with the DELETE method could be used to delete an object.

```http
DELETE /api/users/foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
```

Although it may be reported by automated scanning tools, the presence of these methods on a RESTful API **is not a security issue**. However, this functionality may have other vulnerabilities (such as weak access control), and should be thoroughly tested.

### TRACE

The `TRACE` method (or Microsoft's equivalent `TRACK` method) causes the server to echo back the contents of the request. This led to a vulnerability called Cross-Site Tracing (XST) to be published in [2003](https://www.cgisecurity.com/whitehat-mirror/WH-WhitePaper_XST_ebook.pdf) (PDF), which could be used to access cookies that had the `HttpOnly` flag set. The `TRACE` method has been blocked in all browsers and plugins for many years; as such, this issue is no longer exploitable. However, it may still be flagged by automated scanning tools, and the `TRACE` method being enabled on a web server suggests that is has not been properly hardened.

### CONNECT

The `CONNECT` method causes the web server to open a TCP connection to another system, and then pass traffic from the client to that system. This could allow an attacker to proxy traffic through the server, in order to hide their source address, access internal systems or access services that are bound to localhost. An example of a `CONNECT` request is shown below:

```http
CONNECT 192.168.0.1:443 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
```

### PATCH

The `PATCH` method is defined in [RFC 5789](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5789), and is used to provide instructions on how an object should be modified. The RFC itself does not define what format these instructions should be in, but various methods are defined in other standards, such as the [RFC 6902 - JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902).

For example, if we have a user called "foo" with the following properties:

```json
{
    "role": "user",
    "email": "foo@example.org"
}
```

The following JSON PATCH request could be used to change the role of this user to "admin", without modifying the email address:

```http
PATCH /api/users/foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org

{ "op": "replace", "path": "/role", "value": "admin" }
```

Although the RFC states that it should include instructions for how the object should be modified, the `PATCH` method is commonly (mis)used to include the changed content instead, as shown below. Much like the previous request, this would change the "role" value to "admin" without modifying the rest of the object. This is in contrast to the `PUT` method, which would overwrite the entire object, and thus result in an object with no "email" attribute.

```http
PATCH /api/users/foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org

{
    "role": "admin"
}
```

As with the `PUT` method, this functionality may have access control weaknesses or other vulnerabilities. Additionally, applications may not perform the same level of input validation when modifying an object as they do when creating one. This could potentially allow malicious values to be injected (such as in a stored cross-site scripting attack), or could allow broken or invalid objects that may result in business logic related issues.

### Testing for Access Control Bypass

If a page on the application redirects users to a login page with a 302 code when they attempt to access it directly, it may be possible to bypass this by making a request with a different HTTP method, such as `HEAD`, `POST` or even a made up method such as `FOO`. If the web application responds with a `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` rather than the expected `HTTP/1.1 302 Found`, it may then be possible to bypass the authentication or authorization. The example below shows how a `HEAD` request may result in a page setting administrative cookies, rather than redirecting the user to a login page:

```http
HEAD /admin/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]
Set-Cookie: adminSessionCookie=[...];
```

Alternatively, it may be possible to make direct requests to pages that cause actions, such as:

```http
HEAD /admin/createUser.php?username=foo&password=bar&role=admin HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
```

Or:

```http
FOO /admin/createUser.php
Host: example.org
Content-Length: 36

username=foo&password=bar&role=admin
```

### Testing for HTTP Method Overriding

Some web frameworks provide a way to override the actual HTTP method in the request. They achieve this by emulating the missing HTTP verbs and passing some custom headers in the requests. The main purpose of this is to circumvent a middleware application (such as a proxy or web application firewall) which blocks specific methods. The following alternative HTTP headers could potentially be used:

- `X-HTTP-Method`
- `X-HTTP-Method-Override`
- `X-Method-Override`

To test this, consider scenarios where restricted verbs like `PUT` or `DELETE` return a `405 Method not allowed`. In such cases, replay the same request, but add the alternative headers for HTTP method overriding. Then, observe the system's response. The application should respond with a different status code (*e.g.* `200 OK`) in cases where method overriding is supported.

The web server in the following example does not allow the `DELETE` method and blocks it:

```http
DELETE /resource.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
[...]
```

After adding the `X-HTTP-Method` header, the server responds to the request with a 200:

```http
GET /resource.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
X-HTTP-Method: DELETE
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]
```

## Remediation

- Ensure that only the required methods are allowed and that these methods are properly configured.
- Ensure that no workarounds are implemented to bypass security measures implemented by user-agents, frameworks, or web servers.
