# The OWASP Foundation

The OWASP Foundation came online on [December 1st, 2001](http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://www.owasp.org). It was established as a not-for-profit charitable organization in the United States on April 21, 2004 to ensure the ongoing availability and support for our work at [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page). OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas. We can be found at [www.owasp.org](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page).

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology. Similar to many open-source software projects, OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative and open way. The [OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project) is a not-for-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success.
