- Reporting: adding how to create security testing case for devs
- https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_Local_Storage_(OTG-CLIENT-012) add Client Side SQLi

Two questions for OWASP:
------------------------------------
- TOOLS discussion: in the old version of Testing Guide we cited open source and commercial ones for each type of test to perform that could help during the analysis. Would you like to cite both?

- CWE: many companies are using this standard, but at the moment not all the Testing Guide tests are mapped to a specified CWE. Is it possible to set up a working team with CWE in order to update it with all the tests we describe in the Testing Guide?
