# Test Scenario Template

This area provides an [example template](999-Foo_Testing/1-Testing_for_a_Cat_in_a_Box.md) and [explanation of that template](999-Foo_Testing/2-Template_Explanation.md) for use in developing guide content. (They are based on fake chapter `999`.)

## Formatting Examples

This folder also shows how to format specific types of content:

- [HTTP Requests and Responses](999-Foo_Testing/3-Format_for_HTTP_Request_Response.md)

## Merged or Retired Tests

When a test is merged into another test, retain the original file to preserve ID continuity.

At the end of the file, include the following reference-style metadata marker:

`[merged]: # (WSTG-XXXX-XX)`

Replace `WSTG-XXXX-XX` with the destination test ID.

This ensures merged tests are explicitly identifiable while keeping the Markdown valid and render-safe.
